/**
 * In many programs (like VS Code), a text space is divided up into a 
 * bunch of rows and a bunch of columns. When you press tab, you move 
 * ahead several spaces in the same row. Let's say a program will move 
 * the cursor to every fourth position (space 0, space 3, space 7, space 
 * 11, etc) after the user presses tab; write a function that given an 
 * input of a current position, returns the space the cursor should 
 * move to when the users presses tab.
 * 
 * For example, if the user is in position 3, tab(3) should move them to 
 * position 7. tab(4) should also move them to position 7, as should tab(5).
